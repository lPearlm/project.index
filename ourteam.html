    <h3>Our Story: From Ocean Love to Ocean Protection</h3>
<p> It all started with a surfboard, a trash bag, and a moment of clarity. In 2018, our founder Maria Rodriguez was surfing off the coast of Costa Rica when she found herself paddling through a disturbing amount of plastic debris. What should have been a pristine marine landscape was instead a sobering reminder of our global environmental crisis. Between waves, she collected fragments of plastic, thinking about how this waste could be transformed into something beautiful and purposeful.
Maria wasn't new to environmental advocacy. With a background in marine biology and sustainable design, she had spent years studying ocean ecosystems and understanding the fashion industry's environmental impact. That day in the water wasn't just another research moment—it was a personal calling.</p>

  <h4>From Inspiration to Action</h4>
<p>Back home in San Diego, Maria began experimenting. Could discarded ocean plastics be transformed into high-performance swimwear? Her tiny studio apartment became a workshop of sustainable innovation. Countless prototypes, countless failures, and countless cups of coffee later, Oceanic Threads was born.
Our first collection was modest—just three swimsuit designs made entirely from reclaimed marine plastics. We didn't have massive venture capital or a huge marketing budget. What we had was passion, technical expertise, and an unwavering commitment to proving that sustainable fashion could be both beautiful and functional.</p>

  <h4>More Than Just a Brand</h4>
<p>We're not interested in greenwashing or superficial sustainability claims. Every decision we make is carefully considered, from our fabric sourcing to our manufacturing partnerships. We work directly with coastal communities in Colombia and Thailand, ensuring fair wages and supporting local economic development.
Our team is a diverse group of designers, marine scientists, environmental activists, and ocean enthusiasts. We're united by a simple belief: that what we wear should reflect our values and respect the planet.</p>
  
  <h4>Our Ongoing Journey</h4>
<p>Today, Oceanic Threads has grown from that tiny studio apartment to a global community of ocean lovers. We've diverted over 250,000 pounds of plastic from marine environments, supported marine conservation projects, and created swimwear that makes people feel confident while supporting environmental restoration.
But we're just getting started</p>

  <p>Every swimpiece we create is a statement. A commitment. A promise to the oceans that sustain us.
Welcome to Oceanic Threads. Let's make waves, not waste.</p>
